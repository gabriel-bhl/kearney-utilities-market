Great part of the problem with debt collection today relies in two main factors:

1. Assign this kind of work to third-party agencies, which leads to inneficient management focus;
2. Limited availability of tools, such as a credit policy, machine learning models and automated processes.


The machine learning model could be used as a guide or improvement of a credit-score policy, identifying
risky and vulnerable clients, adjusting discount or increase of payment terms and installments accordingly. A paymment plan
can be personalized and product suggestions more effective.

It could also be used to build a customer lifecycle:

1. Acquisition: Enrollment of new customers, historical background to ensure good new clients, product suggestions;
2. Evalluation: daily monitoring of clients, flagging out evidences of "pre-late" payments and act preemptively, 
not punitively;
3. Automation: easier payment methods (digitalization), avoiding billing issues. Data aggregation in a whole dedicated environment;
4. Collection: educate customers on good credit scores, client's segmentation by payments, demography.
